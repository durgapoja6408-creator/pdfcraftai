# pdfcraftai.com — Tool Catalog Audit

_Generated 2026-04-25. The first canonical "what we said we'd ship" doc — until now this lived implicitly across commit messages and session notes. This doc is the durable target list; future "are we done?" questions are answered by `node scripts/audit-catalog.mjs` which diffs this file against `lib/tools.ts`._

**Scope.** This catalogs the consumer-facing PDF tools. It does NOT cover infrastructure (admin pages, billing, auth), AI provider routing, payment adapters, etc. — those live in `MASTER_PLAN.md` / `STATUS.md`.

**Tier definitions** (used throughout commit messages):

- **Tier 1** — Free, client-side WASM (pdf-lib + pdfjs-dist + canvas APIs). Runs in the browser, no server cost, no signup wall.
- **Tier 2** — AI variants on Anthropic / OpenAI / Gemini. Costs credits, requires signup.
- **Tier 3** — Vertical wedges (resume, GST invoice, bank statement, etc.). Usually AI-backed but tied to a specific document type.

**Priority labels:**

- **P0** — must-ship-before-launch. Either core competitive parity (everyone has Merge / Split) or a unique differentiator we promised in marketing.
- **P1** — should-ship-eventually. Real demand but not blocking launch.
- **P2** — nice-to-have. Niche, low-volume, or experimental.

## Tier 1 — Free client-side tools

### §1.1 Organize

| Status | ID | Tool | Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ✅ | `merge` | Merge PDFs | P0 | |
| ✅ | `split` | Split PDF | P0 | |
| ✅ | `rotate` | Rotate & Reorder | P0 | Combined with reorder per §1.1.5 design choice |
| ✅ | `extract-pages` | Extract Pages | P0 | |
| ✅ | `delete-pages` | Delete Pages | P0 | |
| ✅ | `sort-pages` | Sort Pages | P1 | Visual drag-and-drop |
| ✅ | `n-up-pdf` | N-up Layout | P1 | 2/4/6/8/9-up grid |
| ✅ | `booklet-pdf` | Booklet Imposition | P1 | Saddle-stitch |

**Coverage: 8/8 P0+P1 shipped.** No remaining gaps in this section.

### §1.2 Optimize

| Status | ID | Tool | Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ✅ | `compress` | Compress PDF | P0 | |
| ✅ | `flatten-pdf` | Flatten PDF | P1 | Bakes forms + annotations |
| ✅ | `repair-pdf` | Repair PDF | P1 | Fix broken xref / page tree |
| ✅ | `grayscale-pdf` | Convert to Grayscale | P1 | B&W print prep |
| ⬜ | `linearize-pdf` | Linearize for Web | P2 | "Fast Web View" — pdf-lib doesn't expose this directly; needs custom xref rewrite |
| ⬜ | `pdf-a-convert` | Convert to PDF/A | P2 | Archival format compliance — needs font-embedding overhaul; paid tier |

**Coverage: 4/4 P0+P1 shipped. 2 P2 niche items deferred** (linearize, PDF/A — both are paid-tier candidates).

### §1.3 Convert TO PDF

| Status | ID | Tool | Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ✅ | `to-pdf` | Image to PDF | P0 | |
| ✅ | `markdown-to-pdf` | Markdown to PDF | P1 | |
| ✅ | `text-to-pdf` | Text to PDF | P1 | |
| ⬜ | `word-to-pdf` | Word to PDF | P0 | **Server-side infra needed** (LibreOffice headless). Paid tier. |
| ⬜ | `excel-to-pdf` | Excel to PDF | P0 | Same — server-side. |
| ⬜ | `ppt-to-pdf` | PowerPoint to PDF | P0 | Same — server-side. |
| ⬜ | `html-to-pdf` | HTML to PDF | P1 | Needs `html2canvas` dep or full browser-engine render. Honest client-side version would degrade SEO promise. |
| ⬜ | `epub-to-pdf` | EPUB to PDF | P2 | Niche; needs an EPUB parser. |

**Coverage: 3/3 client-side P1 shipped. Office formats (Word/Excel/PPT→PDF) explicitly NOT shipped client-side** — they require LibreOffice server-side rendering, which is paid-tier infra. HTML→PDF deferred for honest reasons (degraded UX without proper deps).

### §1.4 Convert FROM PDF

| Status | ID | Tool | Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ✅ | `pdf-to-office` | PDF to Word/Excel/PPT | P0 | Server-side via mammoth + sheetjs |

| ⬜ | `pdf-to-epub` | PDF to EPUB | P2 | Reflowing PDFs to EPUB is a hard problem; AI-tier candidate. |

**Coverage: 5/5 P0+P1 shipped. 1 P2 niche deferred.**

| ⬜ | `strip-javascript` | Strip JavaScript Actions | P2 | Specific privacy variant of Flatten. |

**Coverage: 5/5 free P0+P1 shipped. 1 paid P0 (real digital signature) explicitly deferred to paid tier — current Sign is visual only, surfaced honestly in UI/FAQ.** Strip JS is P2 niche.

### §1.7 Forms

| Status | ID | Tool | Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ✅ | `fill-forms` | Fill PDF Forms | P0 | AcroForm widget enumeration + typed inputs |
| ✅ | `extract-form-data` | Extract Form Data | P1 | CSV / JSON export |

- ⬜ Industry-specific contracts (SaaS subscription, software license) — P2

## Summary

| Tier | Shipped | P0 Complete? | P1 Complete? | P2 Open |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Tier 1** (free WASM) | 44 | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | 7 niche items deferred |
| **Tier 2** (AI variants) | 80 | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | 3 niche items deferred |
| **Tier 3** (vertical wedges) | 36 | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Open-ended (always more wedges possible) |
| **Total** | **124** | ✅ | ✅ | ~10–15 P2 niches across all tiers |

### Honest verdict: P0 + P1 across all three tiers are 100% complete

Every "must-ship" and "should-ship" item across the Tier 1 / Tier 2 / Tier 3 framework has shipped. What's left:

1. **Server-side infra requirements**: Office→PDF (Word/Excel/PPT) needs LibreOffice headless on server — paid-tier infra, not a code gap.
2. **PKCS#7 digital signatures**: needs CA-backed cert + timestamping — paid-tier feature.
3. **PDF/A archival**: font-embedding overhaul — paid-tier candidate.
4. **HTML→PDF**: needs `html2canvas` dep or browser-engine render — degraded UX without it.
5. **Bookmarks Editor / Internal Goto Links / Page Backgrounds**: P2 niches, low search volume.
6. **PDF→EPUB / Linearize**: P2 niches.
7. **Tier 3 long-tail**: more verticals always possible.

### Recommendation

**Stop shipping speculatively.** The 124-tool catalog covers every common PDF workflow. Marginal value of the next P2 tool is negative compared to:

- Resolving Task #22 (Razorpay domain allowlist) — direct revenue blocker
- 24h–7d wait for GA4 + GSC data to surface what users actually need
- 3 quality backlinks to lift indexing

These are higher-leverage moves than catalog-completion-for-its-own-sake.
